## 🤖 AI Workflow

We used Cursor.ai throughout the project:

1. Launch Cursor.ai in VS Code.
2. Prompt: "Create a responsive header with logo and nav links."
3. Accept Cursor.ai's suggestion and tweak as needed.
4. Repeat for components, styles, API calls, and tests.

Result: a fast and seamless AI-augmented development flow.
